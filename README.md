# ECE1000-Plant Watering Project
The Final Project of this semester that Im doing is the plant watering system. 

## Components
* Pico Breadboard
* Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2
* High/Low Relay Module Trigger

## Complications
While completing this project a complication arose due to what I can only assume is a hardware issue.
I say this because the High/Low Relay Module Trigger wouldnt quite finish the connection with the other circuit, so I had to slightly alter the code and the wire pathing to allow it to work as intended.
In addition to this, I didn't quite know how to calibrate the sensor to be as precise as I would have liked it to be, but after a lot of trial and error I managed to get it to work under acceptable terms.

### Image[2]: After the Moisture sensor has detected an adequate level of water, it shuts off the pump, Indicated by the lack of the glowing red light on the Relay Trigger

# ECE1000-Plant Watering Project
The Final Project of this semester that Im doing is the plant watering system. 

## Components
* Pico Breadboard
* Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2
* High/Low Relay Module Trigger

## Complications
While completing this project a complication arose due to what I can only assume is a hardware issue.
I say this because the High/Low Relay Module Trigger wouldnt quite finish the connection with the other circuit, so I had to slightly alter the code and the wire pathing to allow it to work as intended.
